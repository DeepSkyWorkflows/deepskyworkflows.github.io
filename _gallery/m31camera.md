description: Anticipating Andromeda. This is the time of year that M31, the Andromeda Galaxy, begins to appear for longer periods of time. I've done some fun shoots in the past, but this year I feel like it's time to go for a magnum opus photo (for me, personally) and I decided to practice some shots. Those are just practice shots, so I won't be posting them, but I did have my Sony Alpha 6300 ride shotgun on the imaging runs. It snapped this photo of the bright stars that define the Andromeda Constellation chasing the galaxy  off the edge of the frame. This is 10 2-minute exposures.
