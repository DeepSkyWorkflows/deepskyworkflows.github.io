type: Nebula
tags: ["IC1396", "Elephant Trunk Nebula"]
description: "IC1396A is the designation for the Elephant Trunk Nebula: a dense cloud of ionized gas that has been compressed into a round shape from opposing forces of a massive star and several younger stars. The larger star illuminates the edge of the cloud and provides contrast for the trunk that curls at the end of a long column of interstellar dust.  It is believed this compressed gas is forming into protostars."
