title: "Colors of the Crab"
type: Nebula
tags: ["M1","NGC1952"]
description: This was a focused capture using 5-minute exposures over two nights with the Optolong L-eXtreme filter. The Crab Nebula was mistaken for a comet by astronomer Charles Messier in the late 1600s. Frustrated, he started a catalog of 'things to avoid' and the Crab was awarded Messier 1 or M1 for short. I wonder what his reaction would have been had he used an EdgeHD instead?
