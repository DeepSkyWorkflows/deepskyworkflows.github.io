description: "Long ago, in a galaxy far away, a massive star (even as stars go) convulsed and shed its outer shell, sending a shockwave that carried plasma, gas, and other material with it. The star followed up by constantly bombarding its environment with radiation. The shell began to emit its own light, which eventually was collected in the lens of my Redcat 71 on the roof of my garage in Newport. 60 1-minute broadband exposures and 60 5-minute narrowband exposures later, I present NGC 6888: The Crescent Nebula and its native habitat."
