description: "It was almost exactly three years ago today that I obtained my first clear image of the veil nebula ... by purchasing a dataset. I was frustrated by the veil's stubborn refusal to appear in broadband, and I was ecstatic to see the final result. Although I've used a wider field to image the full Cygnus loop, this was my first time revisiting the target. It is a beautiful gossamer expanse of interwoven interstellar threads adorned by the brilliantly shining diamond 52 Cygni."
