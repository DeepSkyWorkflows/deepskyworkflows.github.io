title: "The Ring of Fire"
type: Solar
tags: [sun, moon, total solar eclipse 2024]
description: At the height of totality, the sun becomes a silver ring in the sky and if you are able to look, you can see bright red dots where the large prominences exist. It is a deeply transforming experience and of all the photos I captured, this one looks closest to what I saw with my unaided eyes.
