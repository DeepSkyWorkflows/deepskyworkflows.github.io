title: "North America Nebula shakedown"
type: "Nebula"
tags: ["The star ξ Cyg", "62 Cyg", "NGC6997", "NGC7000", "North America Nebula"]
target: "NGC7000"
description: "Shakedown for first light with new rig. Limited window of sky at my location meant short time on each target. Spent less than one hour exposure each on bright nebulae, a cluster and a galaxy. Minimal processing but I'm excited for the potential. First target was the North America Nebula. Rig: William Optics Redcat 71 (338mm f/5), ZWO ASI294MM Pro (monochrome), ZWO 8-filter wheel (used 7: LRGBSHO). 160mm Orion guide scope with ZWO ASI290MM Mini. All on a ZWO AM5 (no need for a counterweight!) mount."
