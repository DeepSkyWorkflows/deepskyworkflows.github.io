description: "Last night's Perseids did not disappoint. The background is a 60-second exposure, then I star-aligned and overlaid the meteors from the other exposures. I usually identify meteors by their color, as satellite flashes are almost always white, and the Perseids are easy to spot because they all 'point' to a common origin near the Andromeda galaxy and the distinctive double cluster in Perseus."
