description: "The Pacific Northwest weather decided to interfere with the last total lunar eclipse of 2022. In order, you see the clear full moon already eclipsed, followed by a smaller sliver exposed through clouds and fog making it bluish, and finally the fully eclipsed red moon partially obscurred by clouds."
