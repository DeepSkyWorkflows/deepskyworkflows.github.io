description: Brilliant Capella is low center in this starfield shot a 50mm with my camera riding piggyback on the main telescope. Blue stars Menkalinan and Bogardus connect with Capella to from the side of the 'modern constellation' Auriga that means 'Charioteer.' To the left is the string of star clusters (M36, M37, and M38). The blue stars to the lower left mark IC405, the Flame Nebula (not visible at such a short exposure).
