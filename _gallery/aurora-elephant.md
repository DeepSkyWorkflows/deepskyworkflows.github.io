description: "OK, so I admit it. I didn't JUST shoot the moon either on the night of the aurora. Although it's not enough data to call final, I did collect enough of the Elephant Trunk Nebula to do a test run and see how good the data is. This is a sample of ~32 minutes (4x3 minutes RGB, 4x5 minutes SHO), for the final piece I'll try to collect between 6 - 8 hours total."
