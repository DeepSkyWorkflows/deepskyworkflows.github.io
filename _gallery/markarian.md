description: "Markarian's chain is a string of galaxies that appear to form a curve from earth. It's an area of the sky where you could throw a virtual dart and hit a galaxy almost every time and includes the Virgo cluster. I'll be zooming into these galaxies for more detail with the higher-powered telescope."
