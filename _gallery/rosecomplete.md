description: This is a second pass at processing the same data. A collection of long exposures combined with a powerful filter and some post-processing reveals the intricate structure and detail of the Rosette Nebula in three dimensions. An oxygen rich core is bathed in blue light that ionizes the dust and gas surrounding the core and causes it to radiate reddish hygroden alpha. Tentrils of dust snake across the opening as the edges fade into the canopy of stars.
