description: An imaging session in February 2024 captured the sun's corona and surface details. February 23, 2024 was an active day for our sun. In this image, the prominent sunspot on the lower left is AR3590. This mega-sunspot is larger than 9 earths and was a record for this 11-year  solar cycle (Solar Cycle 25). Although AR3590 was known to produce one of the largest and strongest solar flares of cycle 25, in this photograph you can clearly see a filament streaming out of AR3591 in the upper left.
