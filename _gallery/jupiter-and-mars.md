description: "This morning a rare event happened that won't recur for another 9 years: due to our perspective from the Earth's orbit, Mars appeared to pass within a short distance of Jupiter. I took a shot using my mirrorless camera because the sensor size combined with the 2,350mm focal distance was perfect to catch the two planets in the same frame."
