description: "It's a popular and iconic region: the first star on the 'belt' of the Orion constellation, Alnitak. This beautiful, bright star is flanked by the distinctive Flame Nebula and easily recognizable Horsehead Nebula. I collected two nights of data with the goal of creating an image that captures the delicate details of the dust and gases that make up the nebulae in this area."
