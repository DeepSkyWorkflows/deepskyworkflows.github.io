description: "It's a galaxy so near it could be interacting with our stars. It's so big and bright that you can photograph it with an ordinary camera. It was originally cataloged as a 'nebula' by Charles Messier in his catalog of 'things to avoid looking at because they're not comets' and was #31 on the list. The Andromeda Galaxy, named for the constellation it hangs out in, is located just off the edge of the distinct 'W' of Cassiopeia. I got a little close to my work this time, imaging over two nights using different exposures to draw out details. I also used a hydrogen alpha filter to find the red emissions hanging out in the limbs of this barred spiral galaxy that is our neighbor."
