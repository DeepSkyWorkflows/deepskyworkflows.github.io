type: Nebula
tags: ["Iris Nebula","NGC7023"]
description: The Iris Nebula is a beautiful reflection nebula lit from behind by a bright star. Although the beautiful blue core is easily visible even with regular camera lenses, it takes dark skies and long exposures to bring out the subtle ripples of dust that appear to expand from the center.
