title: "The Newport Leonid"
type: "Meteor"
tags: [meteor, jupiter]
target: "meteor"
description: "I set out my camera and programmed it for 25-second exposures to run all night long. I love to see videos made from timelapses like this, but I also was in search of a meteor. The Leonids are reaching their peak and indeed I captured one oriented in the direction of faraway constellation Leo. I believe the green indicates a good amount of magnesium, or maybe it's just chromatic aberration.
The meteor chose a terrific frame to appear in. Orion fits perfectly between the two power lines. Aldebaran blazes brightly just below the green streak of metals burning in the atmosphere. The meteor is a Leonid, as an imaginary line drawn through it would terminate near the constellation Leo. As a bonus, the bright white object just about to exit the stage right is none other than Jupiter."
