title: "Eclipse Burn"
type: Solar
tags: [sun, total solar eclipse 2024]
description: During the eclipse, there was an instant just as the moon covered the sun that the corona was not yet visible. The moon fully covers the sun's disc but not the prominences that arch above the chromosphere, so these get captured in this type of exposure.
