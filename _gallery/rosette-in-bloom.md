description: "Caldwell 49 is the designation for the nebula commonly known as the Rosette Nebula. This is a massive nebula that hide a star-forming region only visible with X-rays. This is my highest fidelity image of the nebula to date. It contains over 10 hours of exposure data from sessions spanning over a year. It has the sharpest details of any nebula I photographed, great color balance and is absolutely stunning on a metal print. I chose an orientation that most closely resembles how it was framed in the sky. If you tilt your head so your chin is pointed at 7:30 and the top of your head to 1:30, you can see why this nebula is sometimes referred to as the Skull Nebula."
