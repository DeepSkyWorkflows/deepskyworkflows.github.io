description: "Taken for the 4th of July: the eagle is the American symbol of strength, freedom, and national pride. So today, I present the Eagle Nebula, M16, a nebula discovered 31 years before the United States declared their independence. It is believed to be about 7,000 light years from earth. I specifically focused on grabbing as much detail on the large pillars in the middle, columns of gas and interstellar dust that wrap around newly forming stars that are hidden in the murk. These 'Pillars of Creation' were made famous by a Hubble Space Telescope photograph. "
