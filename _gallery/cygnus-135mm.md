description: "The Sadr region is an area of the Cygnus galaxy near the star Sadr known for its intense nebulosity. It also happens to host 1 or 2 stars as evidenced by this stack of 120 90-second exposures (3 hours) taken with a Sony Alpha 6300 and Samyang 135mm manual focus lens riding 'piggyback' on my main telescope."
