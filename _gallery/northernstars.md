description: Hours of 2-minute exposures using my Sony Alpha 6300 reveal the Milky Way's wall of stars, galaxies, and nebulae that's practically a 'star map' of who's who in common targets. Visible targets include Messier 52 (a cluster), the Bow-tie Nebula, the Bubble Nebula, and the Wizard Nebula. There are several other planetary and diffuse nebulae and galaxies to boot.
