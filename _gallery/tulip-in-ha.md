title: "The Tulip Nebula in Hydrogen Alpha"
type: Nebula
tags: [SH2-101]
description: "SH2-101 is an emission nebula in the Cygnus cloud region. It is in direct line with the Milky Way and therefore lies in an abundant starfield. I first imaged the Tulip Nebula in July 2021. In the first image, the bright red star in the lower right is Cygnus X-1, part of a binary star system that includes black hole. You can't see it, but its signature is visible in X-ray emissions. I imaged it three more times through June 2022 and combined the data for the second image. Last night, I started a new data set. This time I got a little closer."
