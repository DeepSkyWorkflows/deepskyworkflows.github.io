description: "IC1396 refers to a massive region of interstellar gas and dust that is ionized by the continuous radiation blasting from the massive star designated HD 206267. It is more commonly known for the concentrated pillar that is starkly illuminated by the star and forms a distinct loop that looks like an elephant's trunk. Hence, IC1396A is also known as 'the Elephant's Trunk Nebula.'"
