target: "IC444"
description: "The last target I chose for 2023 is a target I haven't attempted since March of 2021, and that captured nothing more than a hint of a sliver of what the structure should look like. Now that I dedicated several hours to the target, I have to admit it's a bit overwhelming. There is so much structure and detail. I rank this with the Cat's Eye Nebula in terms of difficulty to image and process, and suspect I'll want more data and will reprocess as I learn more. For now, this is my best effort with IC444: The Jellyfish Nebula."
