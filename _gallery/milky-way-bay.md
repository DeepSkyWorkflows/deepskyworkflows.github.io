description: "On a night I spent taking photos from a bluff in Otter Rock, Oregon, I was surprised to see the Milky Way lurking above the city lights and behind the light pollution. A single frame captured enough to show it in this picture facing almost directly south looking down the coast and past Gull Rock and the Yaquina Head Lighthouse."
