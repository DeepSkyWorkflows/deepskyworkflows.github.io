description: "Yesterday at a local festival, I had the opportunity to share what the surface of the sun looks like through a solar scope that I set up next to my booth. Everyone was blown away at the flares. I couldn't wait to get home and grab my camera to image it. The sun today was quite active, and the amazing flare is still there."
