title: "The Ghost of Cassiopeia"
type: Nebula
tags: ["27 Cas","IC59","IC63","The star Navi (γ Cas)"]
description: This is my first attempt at the elusive and transluscent Ghost of Cassiopeia. It's in an easy location next to Navi, a major star in the constellation, but is a dark and detailed nebulae requiring long exposures and clear skies.
