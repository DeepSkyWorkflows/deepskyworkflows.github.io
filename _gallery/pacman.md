description: NGC281 is the designation for a cluster of high mass stars that are 'only' 6,500 light-years away. They are also elevated from the galactic plane, making for easier observation. A thick band of dark cosmic dusk creates the illusion of a gaping mouth on what is called the Pacman Nebula.
