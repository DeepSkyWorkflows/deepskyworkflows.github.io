description: The haunting image of massive interstellar dust pillars captured by the Hubble telescope existed only in myth until I saw them stand out distinctly against the background in one of my first photos of M16, the Eagle Nebula. Those images felt unfished. Hopefully, this one is ready. I present M16 and the Pillars of Creation.
