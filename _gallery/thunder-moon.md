description: A supermoon occurs when the moon's orbit brings it closer to Earth, so it appears bigger and brighter. The July supermoon is expected to be the brightest of the year. It's called the Thunder moon because it heralds the season of thunderstorms in the North American summer. This is a mosaic taken from four zoomed shots.
