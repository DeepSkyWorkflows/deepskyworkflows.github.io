title: "Westerhous 5: The Soul Nebula"
type: Nebula
tags: ["IC1848","IC1871", "Westerhous 5"]
description: This large, intricate nebula is located next to the equally magnificent Heart Nebula, making them heart and soul together. This was a special capture because I used an ordinary star tracker (the Sky Watcher Star Adventurer Mini or SAM) on a tripod but managed to capture good images all night long.
