description: "Yeah, well awake before the break that dawns on night,
Nothing at stake but subs to take in low moonlight.
Venus bright, the moon a sliver curving line
When behold the sight unfolds and unfurls earthshine.
50 millimeters on a Samyang lens with a Sony Alpha it were,
6300 the model 6 seconds the throttle the image now all but secure."
