description: "I visited friends with a deck overlooking the bay where the ferries shuttle people between islands and the mainland. Using my Sony Alpha camera on a tripod, I took several 20-second exposures to combine for the Milky Way. The ferry happened to cross around the same time and left a dazzling bar of light."
