type: Lunar
tags: [moon]
description: It's been cloudy for days, so when I woke up and saw the moon, I knew I had to photograph it. I quickly grabbed my 2x Barlow lens, e-mount adapter, Sony Alpha 6300 and Svbony sv503 70ED and assembled them to shoot about 4 minutes. I processed in AstroSurface (video coming).
