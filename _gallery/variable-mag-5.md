title: "The Variable Magnitude M5"
type: Cluster
tags: ["NGC5904","M5"]
description: Low in the horizon this time of year lurks a star cluster filled with variable stars that cycle their magnitude over time. I didn't stay long, but this single 5-minute exposure was all I needed to capture Messier 5.
