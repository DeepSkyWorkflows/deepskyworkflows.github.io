description: During the trek up a 1-mile, 1,200-foot fire service road to reach the lookout, we encountered thunder (but not lightning), a black bear, storm clouds and more. However, later that evening the skies clear and this happened. After verifying the Milky Way was visible with my 12mm lens, I decided to switch to the 50mm lens.
