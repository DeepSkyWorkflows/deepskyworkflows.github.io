description: "I captured this target from the top of Heybrook Lookout in Index, WA (Bortle 3).I only spent about 20 minutes on Antares, a region that deserves hours of exposure. But even with the limited time, I captured more details than ever before, trumping the hours of filtered shooting through light polluted skies from my house."
