title: "The Full Moon and Milky Way"
type: Milky Way
tags: [moon, "Milky Way"]
description: "My answer to the question: can you capture the Milky Way during a full moon? Sure, but why go through the trouble? Dark skies rule, but clear skies can be forgiving. Although the moon was right in front of the Milky Way, I shot it directly for 45 seconds at my lowest ISO. You can clearly see lens flare, dark spots from dust on the lens, and our own galaxy."
