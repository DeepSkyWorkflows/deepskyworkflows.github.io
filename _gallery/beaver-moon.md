description: "The November full moon is known as the Beaver moon. To create this image, I captured several hundred images with my Celestron Universe #EdgeHD 9.25 scope at 1.635 meters focal length. I used a ZWO ASI #asi294mmpro cooled camera in a mode that captures 8k x 5k images. The magnification was so high that I had to do a mosaic. I imaged the top 4/5ths with red, green, and blue filters, then the same with the bottom. I aligned the top and bottom and blended them for each filter, then aligned the full disk for red, green, and blue to produce a color image.
Here it is!"
