title: "Moon and Mars Ring"
type: Lunar
tags: [moon, mars]
description: It was a cloudy evening as we kicked off 2023. The moon was near Mars, but the clouds threatened to destroy any chance of photographing them. However, something else happened. The moon created a rainbow-like ring in the clouds and Mars punched through a thin opening. This moonring was created by combining a fast exposure (for the moon detail) with a slow exposure.
