description: "In the Southern Cross (or Cygnus) where a star no longer glows,
Its energy loans the colorful bones that filaments expose /
Threads of red and strands of green entangle in their space,
The expanding shell of the star that fell and is no longer in its place.
The Witch's Broom as some presume is just part of a bigger tale /
Of Cirrus clouds, Pickering's Triangle and the Eastern and Western Veil.
In space it's stranded the filaments expanded and twisted around the core /
That attracts our gaze as we trace the maze, both amazed and grateful yet more."
