title: "The Eye of God"
type: Nebula
tags: ["Helix Nebula","NGC7293"]
description: NGC7293 is a planetary nebula that stays low on the horizon at my latitude. It is almost always low in the atmosphere glow of the horizon and often near a streetlamp. I wasn't expecting much when I spent an hour taking 20 5-minute captures while waiting for the Pleiades to rise, but I was surprised when I processed the results. This nebula is less than 1000 light years away. Do you feel like someone is watching you? It should be obvious why the Helix Nebula is sometimes called the 'Eye of God.'
