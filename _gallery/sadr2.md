title: "The Sadr Region Take Two"
type: Nebula
tags: ["37 Cyg","NGC6910","The star Sadr (γ Cyg)"]
description: The Sadr region is the name of the nebulosity that surrounds the brilliant center star of Cygnus' cross. Here, the massive supergiant estimated to contain over 10 times the mass the sun in a radius 150 times as wide glows triumphantly in the center of the frame. I used a new technique to bring out new detail from an old capture.
