description: "From the high point of a lookout on Cape Foulweather, a stop along the beautiful Otter Crest Loop that splits from Highway 101 on the Oregon Coast at Otter Rock to meander past bluffs and rock formations, you can look south down the coast to the town of Newport or west out over the open sea. Not far from the lookout are the imposing edges of the large Gull Rock (often mistaken for Otter Rock, but that's a flatter feature farther south). I planned for several weeks to capture the Milky Way rising behind Gull Rock. Instead of rising behind it, however, the enormous Milky Way just seemed to swallow it. This is a 30-second exposure featuring the rock, the edge of our galaxy and the light from several boats on the water."
