description: "The vastness of space displaced in the space / Of a nebulous brain with an invisible face / Both explosion and implosion as the stellar winds blow / From a Wolf-Rayet star with a nuclear glow / Its membrane stretched thin: what will the fate / Be of this structure named NGC6 triple-8?"
