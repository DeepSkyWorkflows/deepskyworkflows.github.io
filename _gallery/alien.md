title: "The East Veil: Alien in Disguise"
type: Nebula
tags: ["IC1340","NGC6979","NGC6992","NGC6995"]
description: The thin, detailed fillaments that interwine to force a complex interplay of base colors are believed to be the surface of an expanding cloud seen edge-on. This is a massive target representing only a portion of the large Cygnus Loop, the remnants of the explosion of a star 20 times more massive than the sun around 15,000 years ago.
