description: "I haven't given any clusters good treatment lately. I personally have a few clusters I love to shoot, with the double cluster in Perseus taking my favorite spot. At a close second is this massive globular cluster in Hercules known as M13. Look closely. Can you count all of the hundreds of thousands of stars?"
