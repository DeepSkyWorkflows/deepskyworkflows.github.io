description: I usually image NGC6888 at a high focal length for a closeup view. This nebula that is apparently fashioned after the human brain is itself located against a backdrop of faint nebulosity. 2 hours is probably not even close to enough total exposure time for best results, but here's the Crescent Nebula so far...
