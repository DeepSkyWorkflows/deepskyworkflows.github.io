title: "A Crab Deconvoluted"
type: Nebula
tags: ["M1","NGC1952"]
description: The first nebula I photographed is also the first item in the Messier Catalog. M1, also referred to as the Crab Nebula, is the remnant of a supernova estimated to have occurred less than 10,000 years ago, with the light taking around 6500 yeas to reach us. At the center sits a spinning neutron star. I decided to revisit M1 as my project for the week. This is the result of 6 hours of exposure over three nights. Processed a second time with BlurXTerminator.
