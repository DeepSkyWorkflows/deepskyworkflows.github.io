type: Nebula
tags: ["Christmas Tree Cluster","NGC2259","NGC2264","The star 15 Mon"]
description: The 'Christmas Tree' is a group of stars in the blueish area lower left that form a triangle with a 'trunk.' It is oriented the same direction as the Cone Nebula, that is indeed the cone you see. There is a ton of nebulosity in the region and one glowing spot isn't a star, it's a galaxy. This is NGC2264, the Christmas Tree Cluster!
