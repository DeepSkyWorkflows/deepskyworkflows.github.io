type: Nebula
tags: ["Erakis (μ Cep)","IC1396","The star The Garnet Star"]
description: In the constellation Cepheus lies a large area of glowing cosmic dust that is silhouetted by surrounding clouds of dark dust. This region is believed to be a star-forming area using materials like the particles that make up a massive column that curls at the end like an elephant's trunk. This is a wide field view of IC1396, the Elephant's Trunk Nebula, processed from regular light and narrowband using the Optolong l-eXtreme filter.
