description: This massive beacon in the night sky on Orion's 'shoulder' is a red supergiant with a mass 10 - 20 times that of our own sun. For comparison, if you exchanged the sun for Betelgeuse, the latter would swallow everything from Mercury through Mars to the asteroid belt. Most astronomers agree it is close to supernova +/- 100,000 years.
