title: "The Crab in 2023"
type: Nebula
tags: ["M1","NGC1952"]
description: To start the new year, I imaged the first item in the Messier catalog on the first day of the year. Coincidentally, M1 was the first deep space object and nebula I photographed. This is a stack of several nights of 5-minute exposures that sum to just over seven hours of integration time.
