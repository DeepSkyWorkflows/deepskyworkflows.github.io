title: "Moon Bottom"
type: Lunar
tags: [moon, plato]
description: Which way is up? Most of my lunar images are framed using the same orientation they were captured, which is fairly arbitrary when considering the camera can be rotated. This image features a large section of the lunar surface dominated by the crater named Plato.
