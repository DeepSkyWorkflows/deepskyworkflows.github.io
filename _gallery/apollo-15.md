Below that, an imaginary line from Aristillus and Autolycus pointing towards the center of the image will land just north of the Apollo 15 landing site on the opposite side of the ridge. The break in the ridge is the boundary between Mare Imbrium (top) and Mare Serinitatis (bottom). The left is dominated by Mare Vaporum. The lower right craters are named Eudoxus and Aristoteles.
