title: "Strawberry Starburst"
type: Galaxy
tags: ["NGC3034","M82","Cigar Galaxy"]
description: Starburst galaxies are believed to experience incredibly rapid star growth compared to other galaxies. M82, the Cigar Galaxy, is both visually and physically located near M81, Bode's Galaxy. Tidal interactions between the two funneled gas into the core of M82 that led to a massive period of rapid star growth. Despite the bright strawberry moon, I was able to capture this image of M82 in the opposite edge of the sky last night from my backyard in Monroe, WA.
