description: "In the popular sweep of nebulae and stars known as Orion's sword is NGC1977, the Running Man. This is a subtle reflection nebula that scatters blue light across vast lanes of space dust. It resembles the smoky outline of a running man casting a shadow on disco fog as a strobe light flashes."
