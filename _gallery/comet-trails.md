title: "Comet Trails"
type: Star Trails
tags: [ Polaris, comets ]
description: With my camera mounted on a Sky Watcher Star Adventurer Mini (S.A.M.) I set up an astrophotography time lapse. This will track for the duration of the exposure, then return to the starting point. I used it for a comet video, then ran my 'Startrails Magic' PixInsight script to create this image. I brightened the comet to make it easier to spot. It is distinctively green an, unlike stars that stay on perfect tracks, the comet crosses over and appears to arc towards Polaris.
