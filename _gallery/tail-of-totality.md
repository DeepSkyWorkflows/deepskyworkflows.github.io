title: "The Tail (end) of Totality"
type: Solar
tags: [sun, moon, total solar eclipse 2024]
description: I took this photograph as the moon was moving away from the sun, signaling the end of the eclipse. The moon creates a stark contrast with the sun that brought out rich details on the surface and edges. The solid edge in the image is caused by the technique I use to create the frame, which is essentially subtracting the surface details from the image of the outer corona to create an inverted rendering that has depth, detail, and contrast.
