description: "he North America nebula is expansive, stretching across a piece of the sky that could hold 10 moons. It is faint in the ordinary light spectrum but glows brightly when you filter on hydrogen alpha. Like many emission nebulae, its gases are being energized from the output of a nearby star and this causes them to emit radiation on their own. It is separated from its neighbor, the Pelican Nebula, by a massive formation of planetary dust. Four hours and thirty minutes of exposure later, here we are. NGC7000, IC5070, the Cygnus Wall, and a whole lot of gas, dust, and stars. I present my personal favorite edition I've done of the North America Nebula."
