description: I experimented with a new set up last night and captured three targets. The second is the region including M16 (the Eagle Nebula), M17 (the Omega Nebula) and M24 (the small Sagittarius star cloud). The camera I used is a Sony Alpha 6300 mirrorless (unmodified) along with a Samyang 135mm manual focus f/2 lens. No telescope
