title: "Foulweather Milky Way"
type: Milky Way
tags: [cape foulweather, milky way]
description: The evening of July 4th was exceptionally clear in Otter Rock, Oregon. Although the moon would still be fairly bright, there was a window of opportunity to image after it got dark around 11pm and before the moon rose at midnight. I could just barely see the Milky Way rise to the north above Cape Foulweather.
