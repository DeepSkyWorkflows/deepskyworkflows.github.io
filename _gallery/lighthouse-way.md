description: "At 2 o'clock in the morning, when the night was dark and undisturbed by the coming dawn, while the moon was absent, I stepped onto the bluff overlooking Moolack Beach with views to the Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area and its lighthouse while Cape Foulweather loomed to the north. The ocean was restless, and waves crashed in a constant barrage that sounded like a violent storm despite only mild breezes. I could clearly see the milky strand of our galaxy stretching from horizon to horizon and stood in wonder and awe for a few minutes. I set up my tripod and had no issues finding north because Polaris was bright and clear. Although I took many exposures, it is this single 30-second shot that captured my attention. The bright glow is from a nearby hotel, and the sparkling gem on the horizon is the Lighthouse beacon with its reflection rippling on the ocean waves."
