description: "Beautiful, sunny day in Newport. I had my tripod aligned from last night, so I attached the solar scope and captured all the activity happening on the sun. The mega-sunspot is AR3697, a new name for the same sunspot responsible for two massive X-flares that combined and hit us head on to produce one of the most intense geomagnetic storms in recorded history back in May."
