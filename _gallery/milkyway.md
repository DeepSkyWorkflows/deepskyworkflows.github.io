title: Milky Way in my Backyard
type: Milky Way
tags: ["milky way"]
description: I live in Bortle 7 as of this picture and therefore cannot see the Milky Way even in a single exposure. However, using a high end tracking mount I was able to combine 89 2-minute exposures and resolve the Milky Way through stacking.
