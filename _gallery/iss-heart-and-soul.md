title: "ISS transit between Heart and Soul"
type: ISS
tags: ["IC1805","IC1848","NGC1027","IC1871", iss]
description: On March 27, 2023, at 20:53 Pacific, the International Space Station (ISS) passed between the Heart (IC1805) and Soul (Westerhaus 5) Nebulae. I captured the transit with a 3-minute exposure at 336mm then superimposed it on previous observations of the nebulae. If you look closely, you can see the faint separation in the middle of its track caused by the gap between the solar panels.
