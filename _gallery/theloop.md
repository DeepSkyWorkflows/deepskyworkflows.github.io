tags: [sun, total solar eclipse 2024]
description: On the day of the total solar eclipse (April 8, 2024) I began photographing the sun early so I could focus and align the scope. I immediately noticed some large prominences, so I zoomed in by adding my TeleVue PowerMate 2.5x and swapping the camera with the ZWO ASI290MM-Mini.
