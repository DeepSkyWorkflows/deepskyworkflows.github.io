title: "The Starlink Train"
type: Milky Way
tags: [Milky Way, Otter Rock]
description: A Starlink satellite train is an eerie thing to witness. It looks like a string of pearls or white dots moving in a straight line that terminates in earth's shadow. This is the first time I caught one on camera. This is 5 45-second exposures stacked together.
