description: "The star ζ Orionis (Alnitak) is the leftmost star on the constellation Orion's belt. It is a triple star system hosted by a blue supergiant. Next to it bursts the Flame Nebula, an emission nebular supercharged by ultraviolet rays emanating from Alnitak. Often grouped with the more iconic Horsehead Nebula (IC434), the Flame stands well on its own."
