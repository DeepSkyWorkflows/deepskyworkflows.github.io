target: "milky way"
description: "I took advantage of one of the last clear nights for several weeks to head a few minutes north of our home to Cape Foulweather. Milky Way season is nearing its end and I wanted to capture it over the water. I didn't plan well as I was not expecting the moon to be so close, or so bright, but in the end, it worked out. Sony Alpha 6300, f/2 12mm Samyang lens on a Sky Adventurer Mini (SAM) tracker."
