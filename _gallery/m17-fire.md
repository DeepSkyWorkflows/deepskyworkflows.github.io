type: Nebula
tags: ["Checkmark Nebula","Lobster Nebula","M17","NGC6618","Swan Nebula","omega Nebula"]
description: "I reprocessed old data with a new technique for this. M17 goes by several different names: Checkmark, Horseshoe, Lobster, Omega and Swan. It is a massive star-forming region that is bright and richly structured. It has a complex structure that is unique due to the almost straight-edged regions of darks and transitions from billowing clouds of molecular gas to long, twisting tendrils."
