description: "I made the mistake of not taking the forecast seriously because I've been disappointed in so many previous events. Because I was at a dark site to shoot a deep sky target, I had an interesting twist: the dark skies made it easy to photograph the aurora, but the dark site had no landmarks for good backdrops and a lot of (thankfully not lit) light posts. The trees did help, as you can see here."
