description: "This is not my favorite quality image, but the target is difficult and I'm getting closer. I think the next imaging session when I remember to take proper calibration frames and shoot under dark skies will be the one I end up printing. For now, here is the Rho Ophiuchi complex in the Antares region captured from a bluff in Otter Rock with a Sony A7R IV unmodified mirrorless camera and a 135mm f/2 Samyang manual focus lens."
