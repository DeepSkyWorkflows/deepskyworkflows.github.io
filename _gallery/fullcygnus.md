description: The Cygnus Loop is a massive supernova remnant that emits radiation across the full electromagnetic spectrum. The broadband or visible portion is often classified as separate nebulae like NGC6960 ('The Veil Nebula' or the 'Witch's broom') and NGC6962. This is a wide field shot that captures the entire loop over 2 hours of exposure with a narrowband filter.
