title: "Stars on the Oregon Coast"
type: Miscellaneous
tags: [M31, M33, "Oregon Coast"]
description: The Oregon Coast is not the best place for astrophotography because of the clouds, but sometimes you just work with them. While a storm was raging and blowing rain on our balcony, I looked up and realized I could see stars on top of the clouds. The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is just to the left of center. If you connect the galaxy to two bright stars left, the three of them point to a soft blur that is the Triangulum Galaxy (M33).
