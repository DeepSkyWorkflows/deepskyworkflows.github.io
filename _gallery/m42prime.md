description: It's a popular target, but it never gets old. Although I've visited the Great Orion Nebula (M42) and de Mairan's Nebula (M43) many times before, I believe this is my most detailed capture yet. The data is from two sessions with Stellina taken exactly one year apart on March 4th, 2021, and 2022. I sifted by hand through over 700 10-second captures to cull it down to around 560 of the 'cleanest', stacked it in AstroPixel Processor and processed it in PixInsight.
