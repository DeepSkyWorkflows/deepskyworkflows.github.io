I'm going to jump right into the subject of this post: my astrophotography inventory. First, if you're new to astrophotography, you might wonder _where_ to pick up equipment. I'll start with the places I shop and then move onto my gear.

# Where to buy

I have four sources that I prefer. [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3CsN0Mz) is my primary source of inventory. I love the variety and convenience. The Amazon brand items are very inexpensive while maintaining quality. I know most items I can have in hand within days of ordering. I use the Amazon store card and receive cashback benefits. This is also the only store I use affiliate links for and receive a commission from. I have no affiliation with the other sources other than being a satisfied paying customer. All links in the post are for items I purchased at retail cost and currently own. No one sponsored this post.

For camera accessories, I prefer [B&H Photo](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/). They are also great for used or secondhand gear. I picked up both of my favorite Sony lenses (both Samyang, one 12mm and the other 50mm) from there for much less than I would have paid if they  were brand new, and they both arrived quickly and in great condition.

For astrophotography, I have two recommendations. My first purchases were from [Woodland Hills Camera](https://telescopes.net). They have a very friendly and helpful staff who helped me piece together my first custom system. I was very happy the service, the products, and their recommendations. I also am a fan of [Highpoint Scientific](https://www.highpointscientific.com/) who I went to for one of my mounts when it was out of stock at the other location. They offer the same support (just ask their sales team for help and they'll take care of you) and also have excellent customer service.

There are many other places to purchase your items but these are the places that have worked well for me!

Now onto the gear. I literally walked around my office and took pictures of where they were. I decided it would be easier (for me, at least) to cover them zone-by-zone rather than trying to categorize and prioritize them. If the items seem to be out of order, it's because they are. Hopefully you gain some ideas about your own storage strategy. If you have suggestions or stories to share, let me know! Comments are turned on and I'd love to chat.

# Stellina

Stellina is an observation station that provides a complete, all-in-one experience out of the box. It's what got me started in astrophotography!

{% include blogimage.html description="Stellina" url="00stellina.jpg" half=true target=true %}

Although my [first photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKA4atJJduz/) weren't so impressive, they were enough to get me hooked. Some of my favorite pieces were created with Stellina, such as this image of the [Great Orion Nebula](/gallery/m42prime).

{% include blogimage.html description="M42: Great Orion Nebula" url="/assets/images/gallery/m42prime/m42prime.jpg" half=true target=true %}

I highly recommend this for beginners because the setup is so easy. You literally set the device out, then run everything from your app. It figures out where it is, aligns itself, takes images and even stacks them. You can either accept the image produced automatically, or download the raw data and process it.

> **ðŸ’¡ TIP:** If were to purchase a similar system today, I'd go for the newer [Vespera](https://vaonis.com/vespera). It's lighter, less expensive, but allows the use of filters. Combined with the built-in [mosaic mode](/video/stellina-covalens) it is capable of producing superior images.

One thing the device is not great at is planetary imaging. If you're more interested in taking pictures of planets, you need something with a big aperture to let in enough light and a long focal length for the proper magnification.

# Celestron EdgeHD 9.25

The next main OTA (optical tube assembly) is my [Celestron EdgeHD 9.25"](https://telescopes.net/celestron-91040-xlt-edgehd-925-optical-tube-assembly-cge.html). 

{% include blogimage.html description="Celestron EdgeHD 9.25" url="01celestronedgehd.jpg" half=true target=true %}

I picked this scope due to its flexibility. The Schmidt-Cassegraine design uses a mirror to triple the focal length to 2350mm. The 9.25" or 235mm aperture makes it f/10 out of the box. I can use the 0.7x flattener to widen the field  of view to 1645mm or add a PowerMate to narrow it to 5875mm. Although I haven't explored the option yet, you can also replace the secondary mirror with a special camera and image at f/2 (470mm). 

Curious about what it's capable of? Here's a link to my [Celestron EdgeHD 9.25 photographs](https://deepskyworkflows.com/gallery/?telescope=Celestron%20EdgeHD%209.25).

Example nebula:

I'm a huge fan!

# Celestron CGEM-II Mount

It takes more than a tube and a camera to capture quality deep space photographs. 

{% include blogimage.html description="Celestron CGEM-II Mount" url="02celestroncgemii.jpg" half=true target=true %}

A mount is the combination of a tripod and a motor capable of supporting the weight of your telescope and cameras or other accessories. The motor rotates to follow the stars as they move across the sky. The right mount is crticial to successful long-exposure astrophotography. At 60 pounds (27kg) the [Celestron CGEM-II Mount and Tripod](https://www.celestron.com/products/cgem-ii-eq-mount-and-tripod) is not considered "portable." It takes time to setup (see an example in my [Celestron CGEM-II first light video](/video/cgem-ii-first-light)) but does a solid job. I originally wanted a [Sky Watcher EQ6-R Pro](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/products/eq6-r-pro), but it was on backorder indefinitely at the time so I went with the CGEM-II. I have not been disappointed!

# Star Adventurer GTi

Compared to the heavier CGEM-II, the [Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer GTi](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/collections/star-adventurer-gti/products/star-adventurer-gti-mount-kit) weighs just 8.2 pounds (3.7 kg) and I use it with the [Manfrotto 190 Aluminum Tripod](https://amzn.to/3GnS4CZ) which adds  another 4.4 pounds (2 kg).

{% include blogimage.html description="Sky Watcher Star Adventurer GTi" url="03staradventurergti.jpg" half=true target=true %}

This is a very portable system that performs well. I've loaded it to its 11 pound (5kg) capacity and had it track accurately for 5-minute exposures in a completely battery-powered setup. All of the sky images taken in my [Cayman collection](/tag/cayman-collection) used this mount including this image of the Andromeda galaxy.

{% include blogimage.html description="M31 Andromeda Galaxy using Star Adventurer GTi" url="/assets/images/gallery/andromeda-cayman/andromeda-cayman.jpg" half=true target=true %}

# Counterweights and bars

One key to successful imaging is balancing your imaging train in both the RA and DEC axis. I have a video that shows [how I balance my mount](/video/crab-nebula-and-more).

{% include blogimage.html description="Counterweights and bars" url="04counterweightsandbars.jpg" half=true target=true %}

Pictured are counterweight bars for the CGEM-II, Star Adventurer Mini (SAM) and Star Adventurer GTi. For the CGEM-II, I picked up an additional weight. 

# All-weather cover

An all-weather cover saves significant time (and effort) when I have aligned my rig and want to leave it out for multiple nights of imaging.

{% include blogimage.html description="All-weather cover" url="05allweathercover.jpg" half=true target=true %}

I chose the [TeleGizmos 365 series cover](http://www.telegizmos.com/365%20cover%20info%20page%20new.htm) because of its reputation and level of coverage. I don't leave my scope out in extreme weather conditions. However, weather is unpredictable in my area of the Pacific Northwest and it can rain when the forecast calls for perfectly clear weather. The cover gives me piece of mind that my equipment is protected from unexpected weather events. It also has a dual function: I use it to keep my equipment clean and dry during imaging sessions in the extreme cold.

# The pegboard: cables and adapters

The pegboard revolutionized how I keep track of my astrophotography gear. I picked one up at a local home improvement store and purchased a variety pack of [pegs](https://amzn.to/3CvS3vM) online.

{% include blogimage.html description="My pegboard" url="06pegboard.jpg" half=true target=true %}

Color-coding the cables has been extremely helpful. I picked up a set of [colored Velcro bands](https://amzn.to/3GQvKn4) to identify the different types of cables. I can now easily find the cable that I need at a glance, while winding and storing is easy with the Velcro to close the loop. In the field, the Velcro helps with cable management.

Looking across the top, left to right, top to bottom, you can see:

- A few **blowers** to keep lenses clean.
- A set of **[digital calipers](https://amzn.to/3CydnAG)** for measuring extensions and adapters to achieve back focus.
- **Pliers** for grip.
- A **screwdriver**.
- A **[green laser](https://amzn.to/3vJvjo2)** that was designed for guns but works just as well to help find targets with the scope. I simply brace the laser against the tube, ensure there are no planes nearby, then turn on the laser and move the scope until it is shining on my target. If I'm not 100% on target in the scope, I'm very close.
- A **[cleaning kit for lenses](https://amzn.to/3kgRrDQ)** including soft cloth, brush, and cleaning fluid.
- **Screws** and **allen wrench (hex keys)** that fit most of my astro pieces.
- **Batteries** because electricity.
- I have a huge collection of **[extensions](https://amzn.to/3CyT2em) and [adapters](https://amzn.to/3GjIuRw)** for attaching cameras, telescopes, filter wheels, and other gear. Some connect different sized threads, while others act as spacers to achieve proper backfocus.
- **USB Mini B cables** (orange) are typical for hand controllers.
- **USB Micro B cables** (green) are common for phones and consumer cameras.
- **[USB 3.0 type A to type B](https://amzn.to/3ifjpzm)** (blue) are what most of my dedicated astrophotography cameras use.
- **[USB 2.0 type A to type B](https://amzn.to/3GO5Q3h)** (red) is common for focusers, filter wheels, and slower cameras.
- The **[strap wrench](https://amzn.to/3IwvcE7)** is a life-saver. See my astrophotography tip "[Unbind a stuck adapter or extension](/video/astro-tip-1)" if you're curious how it works.
- RS232/RJ11 cables to connect hand controllers and accessories to the mount.
- USB extension cords for more reach.
- Miscellaneous caps for cameras and parts of the imaging train.

On the floor is a **Celestron power brick** for powering my mount in the field.

# The organizer: bits and pieces

Another great investment for me was a tool chest that I bought on sale from a local home improvement store. Instead of storing tools, I store astrophotography gear. I picked up these [bins](https://amzn.to/3GqPN9Y) to organize some items on top.

{% include blogimage.html description="The organizer" url="07bitsandpieces.jpg" half=true target=true %}

What you see includes:

- More **batteries** (inside the black pouch).
- A **[battery tester](https://amzn.to/3CvVtOX)** that uses the current of the battery you're testing.
- More **pliers**.
- **Screwdrivers**, including jewelers size for some camera and adapter screws.
- **Zip ties**.
- **Tripod adapter screws** for various ways of switching between 1/4" and 3/8" threads.
- Several sets of **[astrophotography screws](https://amzn.to/3ik3BeD)**.
- Removable **knobs**.
- **Extenders** for tripod connections.
- Lots of **Allen wrenches (hex keys)**.

# Filters and tools

Next stop is the top set of drawers in my tool chest.

{% include blogimage.html description="Filters and tools" url="08filtersandtools.jpg" half=true target=true %}

## Filters

In the left drawer I keep all of my filters. These include:

- The **[Optolong L-Pro 1.25"](https://www.highpointscientific.com/optolong-l-pro-astronomy-filter-1-25inch-mounted-lpro-125)** light pollution filter.
- The **[Optolong L-eXtreme 1.25"](https://amzn.to/3GpFTpl)** narrowband pass filter.
- An **IR850 pass filter** (blocks visible light and passes infrared for cameras that can sense it).
- A **CH4 methane pass filter** that can enhance the details of certain planets by adding detail to the luminosity channel.
- I have standard **UV/IR cut filter** by Svbony and another one by ZWO. 
- The **red, green, and blue (RGB) filters** needed by my monochrome planetary imaging camera.

> **ðŸ’¡ TIP:** read the fine print, but the "L" or "luminance" filter you receive with RGB filters is often a UV/IR cut filter as well.

## Tools

The other small drawers hold a variety of tools.

- An **[Electronic Filter Wheel (EFW)](https://telescopes.net/zwo-5-position-filter-wheel-1-25.html)** for automatically changing filters. This one is a 5-spot carousel for 1.25" filters that adds 20mm to the image train.
- In case we need to find our way: a **[compass](https://amzn.to/3H9EcOg)**. OK, so less dramatically, it helps me find North to do a rough alignment of my scope and mount.
- I already mentioned all the **Allens**, and this wrench is great at providing most of the available hex key sizes for me. 
- I also keep extra **USB plug adapters**.

# Phones and chargers

To keep things simple, I try to keep most phone-related items together.

{% include blogimage.html description="Phones and chargers" url="09phonesandchargers.jpg" half=true target=true %}

- I can power most of my setup with **[power bricks](https://amzn.to/3CzJjVk)**. I keep several and always bring more than one with me on trips just in case.
- For my camera, I use an **[infinity battery](https://amzn.to/3ZfXsAR)**. There is an adapter for my camera that looks like a standard battery with a long USB tail. The tail part plugs into the "infinity battery" which of course does not have infinite capacity and itself plugs into a power supply. The "infinity" part is because I can disconnect the battery from the power brick and it will still hold a charge. This allows me to swap batteries on-the-fly without interrupting an imaging session because power flows even after I detach it from the base. If I have grid power, I use a plug adapter for the USB, otherwise I use one of my "bricks." These are also great for spur of the moment setup.
- Sometimes I use an "old school" **[intervalometer](https://amzn.to/3XqqM60)** for my camera shots.
- Finally there are **extensions for cabling** that both extend the distance my mount can reach from the power source and help manage cables.

# Dew protection

It gets damp and foggy quite frequently where I leave, so **dew heaters** are a must. 

{% include blogimage.html description="Dew protection" url="10dewprotection.jpg" half=true target=true %}

My big telescope has a ring integrated onto the lens that heats it. For the rest of my gear, I use a simple **[heater strip with regulator](https://amzn.to/3vLXp2b)**. It so far has worked flawlessly for me.

# Hardware

There's no other way to describe the contents of the next drawer other than "hardware."

{% include blogimage.html description="Hardware" url="11hardware.jpg" half=true target=true %}

This drawer contains many elements crucial to a successful night of imaging. 

- The **[powered USB hub](https://amzn.to/3XcvO5K)** can be attached to the mount and simplify routing of USB cables while powering some devices as well. 
- I have a variety of different **AC/DC adapters** from 5V to 12V that run the various mounts or power the cooler in my camera.
- The brain of my gear is the **[Intel NUC](https://amzn.to/3ikp1In)**. This small, square device acts like a mini-desktop. I chose it over the ASIAir so I can customize the installation. All of my astrophotography programs are installed on the NUC. By keeping it next to my rig, I can remote from my laptop and control it from anywhere. That's a must for evenings that drop well below freezing. It also has a generous amount of USB ports so I don't have to worry about traffic issues using a hub.
- The **Celestron NexStar hand controller** is actually quite useful for slewing the scope, especially when I'm trying to align on a star and planet.

# Cameras and lenses

I try to keep all of my optics in the same place.

{% include blogimage.html description="Lenses" url="12lenses.jpg" half=true target=true %}

- The mirrorless camera I use is a **Sony Alpha 6300**.
- My favorite wide field "Milky Way" lens is the **[Samyang 12mm f/2.0 MF](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=12mm%20samyang%20e-mount&sts=ma)**.
- My favorite wide field constellation lens is the **[Samyang 50mm f/1.4 MF](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=50mm%20samyang%20e-mount&sts=ma)**.
- The planetary camera (color) I use is the **[QHY5III462C](https://www.qhyccd.com/planetary-camera-qhy5iii462c/)**.

Here's an example picture I took with the QHY camera:

{% include blogimage.html description="Ptolemaeus" url="/assets/images/gallery/ptolemaeus/ptolemaeus.jpg" half=true target=true %}

- For planetary (mono) and guiding I use the **[ZWO ASI120MM-S](https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi120mm-s)**.
- For planetary, I increase my focal length up to 2.5 times using the **[TeleVue PowerMate 2.5x](https://amzn.to/3QpqZUy)**.
- I also use the **Zhumell Barlow 2x**.
- For extremely wide fields I  use the **[Apertura 0.5x reducer](https://www.highpointscientific.com/apertura-2inch-0pt5x-focal-reducer-fr2)**.
- My **[Svbony 0.8x reducer](https://amzn.to/3VNFfHO)** flattens the field of view for better astrophotography results.
- The **[ZWO ADC (Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector)](https://amzn.to/3WXu6FG)** helps correct distortion caused by the atmosphere when I image with a color planetary camera.
- The **[1.25" diagonal](https://amzn.to/3iheON3)** is used for visual observation and connects to my doublet refractor.
- I use the **2" diagonal** on my bigger Celestron.
- The **[10mm-30mm zoom eyepiece](https://amzn.to/3IOW3eP)** helps me find my target in a wide field of view, then zoom in to see the details.
- I also keep the Star Adventurer Mini **polar scope** and illuminator here.

# Lens and tripod accessories

The next drawer is all about attaching things to other things.

{% include blogimage.html description="Lens and tripod accessories" url="13lensandtripodaccessories.jpg" half=true target=true %}

- You can never too many replacement **batteries**.
- A **trigger grip** for my tripod.
- A **ball head** for my tripod.
- The **[Dovetail camera cheese plate](https://amzn.to/3it5JR7)** makes it easy to attach accessories and scopes and is easily locked into a Dovetail clamp.
- The **rail** serves a similar function. 
- I use a **[flexible extension tube](https://amzn.to/3QpmqJV)** with Barlow lenses to help achieve focus.
- A **[dovetail clamp](https://amzn.to/3XcJvl5)** is handy for attaching accessories like guide scopes.
- The green device is a **dovetail rail camera adapter** that makes it easy to attach my mirrorless camera to a telescope mount.
- I also am a huge fan of **"[The clamp](https://amzn.to/3GKYehU)"** which is a multi-purpose clamp with tripod and camera threads. I use it to add extra weight for balance or to hang weights to stabilize the tripod.  

# Scopes and what not

The bottom space in my tool chest is where the largest items end up.

{% include blogimage.html description="Scopes and what not" url="14scopesandwhatnot.jpg" half=true target=true %}

- My "wider" field of view (336mm w/ reducer to 840mm w/ Barlow) **[Svbony sv503 70ED doublet refractor](https://amzn.to/3CwjMMS)**.

This is an _incredibly_ affordable scope that takes phenomenal shots! If you're interested, watch my [Svbony sv503 70ED review](/svbony-sv503-review).

- The 50mm **[Svbony SV106 guide scope](https://amzn.to/3GOjZ0o)**.
- Various **SCT adapters** for attaching accessories to the tube.
- A **[Celestron 0.7x reducer](https://telescopes.net/celestron-reducer-lens-7x-edgehd-925.html)** to flatten the field of view for astrophotography.
- The **[Celestron dew controller](https://telescopes.net/celestron-smart-dewheater-controller-2x.html)** to manage the dew ring and keep the lens from fogging over.
- A versatile **cell phone tripod** usually for recording my rig and me in the field.
- A **cell phone eyepiece adapter** for using your phone camera to record the view through an eyepiece.
- A **[Vixen/Losmandy clamp](https://amzn.to/3WeSh1d)** for attaching accessories like extra cameras or guide scopes to the Celestron.
- The **[ZWO ASI294MC Pro](https://telescopes.net/zwo-asi294mc-pro-imx294-color-cmos-camera.html)** cooled astrophotography camera.
- The parts to my **[Star Adventurer Mini](https://telescopes.net/sky-watcher-star-adventurer-mini.html)** portable star tracker.

The S.A.M. is an amazing device! Check out my [complete guide to the Star Adventurer Mini (SAM)](/video/complete-guide-star-adventurer-mini/) to learn more.

- **[Vibration suppression pads](https://amzn.to/3GlZcjj)** to stabilize the mount.
- An **[Outdoor Surge protector](https://amzn.to/3vKGjl5)** to give me plugs while safeguarding against surges.

# Storage pegboard

The side of my tool chest has a built-in pegboard.

{% include blogimage.html description="Storage pegboard" url="15storagepegboardside.jpg" half=true target=true %}

I use it to hang miscellaneous **USB cables**.

# LED tracing pad

My solution for taking flats.

{% include blogimage.html description="LED tracing pad" url="16ledtracingpad.jpg" half=true target=true %}

The **[LitEnergy LED tracing pad](https://amzn.to/3Xh3M95)** is intended to make it easier to trace over existing drawings, but it works just as well for me to take flats. It has adjustable brightness. At the end of my imaging sessions, I point the telescope to the zenith (so it is facing directly up) then set this bright side down on top of the lens. [N.I.N.A.'s flat wizard](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/docs/master/site/tabs/flatwizard/) takes care of the rest.

# Plastic bin

My **plastic bin** is a multipurpose tool.

{% include blogimage.html description="Plastic bin" url="17plasticbin.jpg" half=true target=true %}

I use it to store my long outdoor extension cords. It also holds all of my cables and accessories I need to bring with my scope and mount. In the field, I can flip it and use the bottom as a table to keep plugs off the ground. I also have a hole cut in one corner. On extremely cold nights, I can put my laptop in the bin and run cables through the hole to keep it functional in below freezing temperatures.

# Conclusion

Wow. That's a lot of gear! Much of it has been acquired over several years. I use almost everything because most purchases happened as the result of me realizing I needed something after a failed attempt at imaging. I hope this tour was helpful to see what's involved beyond the obvious tube and mount. I also wanted to share my solutions for storing equipment and accessories in case you needed inspiration.

Clear skies!
