The goal was to refresh the design to provide an experience that is optimal for the device you are using (from phones to tablets, laptops, and desktop PCs) and more accesible by providing proper contrast, annotations for screen readers and metadata for assistive technology."

Earlier this year, a gentleman named João approached me with a proposition. He is fan of my site but pointed out it could really use a design refresh. I couldn't agree more. I'm great at figuring out how to code the solution for a problem, but fairly ignorant when it comes to the design aspect. João proceeded to create a mobile-friendly, mobile-first makeover of the website and provided me with the design using  a tool called Figma. I was really impressed and happy with the samples he shared. I decided that the best way for me to learn CSS would be to attempt to implement the design myself. So I did.

The older version of this site was heavily based on the Bootstrap grid system. I redesigned the new site using the new flex system. It means it may be incompatible with some older browsers, but I'm banking on the fact that most of you are using more modern technology. I redesigned the entire site and stripped away the dependencies for a theme that I was modifying and built a new set of CSS and supporting JavaScript from scratch.

Of course, I'm just one person with a few devices, so I am interested in your help if you are able to. Just take a peek around and if you see something odd or not working, let me know! Many of you are incredibly thorough and I value your feedback, especially if you're using non-Windows or unusually sized screens.
