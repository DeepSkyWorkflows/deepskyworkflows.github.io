I'm writing to share that the Oregon Coast 2024 Calendar is ready. I am very late in bringing this to you and will miss the holidays, but I'm way ahead of last year when the calendar just wasn't turning out. This year I not only found a design that I loved and could customize to add astronomy-related events, but also the print quality is amazing. 

{% include blogimage.html description="Oregon Coast Astrophotography 2024 calendar" url="cal2024cover.jpg" half=true target=true %}

Each month features a favorite photograph of (mostly) deep sky objects that I captured on the coast, with a few pictures of the coast thrown in.

In addition to holidays and days of observance, I included moon phases, meteor showers, eclipses, and more.

If you're interested in seeing the pictures that are included, you can browse the [Oregon Coast Astrophotography 2024 Calendar Gallery](https://deepskyworkflows.shootproof.com/2024) that contains all twelve full-sized prints, plus the cover.

The only caveat is that I started late so I won't be able to deliver them until January. I included the cover image in case you want to print that and put in a stocking as a promise that "it's on the way." 

I apologize to my international guests as I am only able to ship to the domestic United States. I'm willing to see what it takes, so if you are international and would like a copy, simply contact me and we'll work out the details.

[Reserve your Oregon Coast Astrophotography 2024 calendar](https://py.pl/2KlpHA).

If you live in the Newport area and aren't opposed to meeting somewhere around town, don't use that link because it includes a flat rate shipping charge. I also have a small discount for locals. You can either reach out or send $32.99 to this [PayPal link](https://paypal.me/jeremylikness) with a note that I can use to get in contact.

I'll get ahead of this process next year to have them ready in time for holidays. I appreciate both your patience and your interest, encouragement, and support. I'm genuinely excited about this calendar that provides you with 13 different photo prints for less than the cost of a single canvas or metal print. Every one of those pictures has a special story that I'll be excited to share as I blog more about the process in the coming months.

To summarize, choices are...

- [Reserve through PayPal](https://py.pl/2KlpHA) (domestic U.S.)
- [Send money through PayPal](https://paypal.me/jeremylikness) (Newport area, in-person pickup, $32.99)
