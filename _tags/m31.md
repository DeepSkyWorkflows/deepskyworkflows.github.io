# The Andromeda Galaxy

M31 is a barred spiral galaxy. It is the nearest galaxy of significant size to our own. Early records refer to it as a nebula. It is visible to the naked eye from dark locations. With a span of over 3 degrees, it is a popular wide field target that fits well in the range of a 200mm - 350mm focal length.
