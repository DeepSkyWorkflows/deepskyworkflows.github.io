Sunspot AR3664 is the designation for a mega sunspot region that appeared in this solar cycle. The region is so active, it produced several record x-flares. These, in turn, were responsible for one of the most active and visible geomagnetic storms in the past century. I created an [aurora motion gallery](https://living-aurora-a-gall.dswgalleries.com/) with scenes from that night.
