Comets are massive balls of ice, dust, and rocky material that have elongated orbits around the sun that may take millions of years to complete. As they approach the sun, solar radiation causes gases to blast from the surface. This effect forms the signature tail that is associated with them. Photographing faint comets can be tricky due to the dual apparent motion of the starfield and comet across the night sky.
