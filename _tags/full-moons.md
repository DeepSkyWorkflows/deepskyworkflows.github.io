There has always been something magical about the full moon. It can appear large or small depending on its position in the sky and distance from earth. A micromoon occurs when the moon is farthest from the earth and a supermoon happens when it is closest to the earth. Traditionally, full moons are given special names based on the month.

You may notice that craters and landmarks look different in the full moon compared to other phases. This is because with full illumination, most of the contrast comes from differing materials on the surface as shadows are minimized. In other phases, the suns angle casts shadows that provide detail.

The term **supermoon** refers to a full moon that occurs when the moon is at perigee in its orbit (closest to the Earth). The closer distance makes it appears slightly larger.
