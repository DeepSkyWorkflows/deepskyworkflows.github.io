## Dark Site

[Index, WA](/external?t=https://goo.gl/maps/LCLdqr4GKjKbpWjg6) is a small town nestled in the Cascades. It is the closest town to Monroe that is in a lower class Bortle zone. There are many places around Index to image. My two favorites are on a bank next to the Skykomish River, and from [Heybrook Lookout fire tower](/tag/heybrook-lookout).
