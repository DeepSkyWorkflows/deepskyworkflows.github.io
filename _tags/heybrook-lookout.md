## Dark Site

[Heybrook Lookout](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/heybrook-lookout) is located just past the town of [Index, WA](/tags/index-washington). It is normally accessible via a fairly difficult hike from a parking lot in US 2. It is a fire tower with full accommodations, but bookings usually fill up within hours of coming available. You can hike to the tower anytime but "quiet hours" are after 10pm and should be respected by both crews inside the cabin and without. The ascent is around 1,200 feet (3658m).
