## Imaging Site

[Monroe, WA](/external?t=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Washington) is where I do most of my imaging. By default, most images in the gallery were taken here. For this curated collection, I specifically tag unique items like [Milky Way shots](/gallery/?q=a&Type=Milky%20Way) or time lapses that I've successfully run from Monroe.
