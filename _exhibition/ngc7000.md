description: "The North America Nebula is a large, sparkling gem that hovers near the constellation Cygnus.  Its outline is similar to the shape of North America complete with a Gulf of Mexico. I love the way longer exposure times bring out the three dimensional quality of the glowing red gases and the brilliant menagerie of colorful stars scattered between the nebula and Earth."
