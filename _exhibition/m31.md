description: "The Andromeda Galaxy is our closest neighboring galaxy. It has two visual neighbors that appear as fuzzy disks: M32 and M110. It is such a large target that producing this much detail typically requires stitching multiple pictures together. For this shot, I rented a premimium telescope located in Spain and remote-controlled it to capture 19 frames with red, green, and blue filters that were recombined to produce the result you  see."
