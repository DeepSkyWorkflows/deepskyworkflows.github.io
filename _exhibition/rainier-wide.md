description: "It was a winter morning, after 7AM but still dark when my wife called me. 'You have to see this.' Sure enough, the dawn light illuminated Mt. Rainier and its background while a solid bank of clouds choked out light from above and loomed over a black landscape. This was a single 1/45s shot at 50mm f/5.6 and ISO 1000 on a Sony Alpha 6300 mirrorless camera. No filters were used in this photo: it's taken raw from nature."
