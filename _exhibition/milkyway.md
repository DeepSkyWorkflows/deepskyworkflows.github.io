description: "This photograph was taken during a trip to Colorado. My daughter and son-in-law knew about my astrophotography hobby and surprised me by offering to take me to Paint Mine, a remote location with darker skies. Although there was a pervasive glow of light pollution low on the horizon from a nearby town, the sky was much darker than what I see in Monroe, WA. I took several long exposures and combined them for my first ever Milky Way astrograph."
