description: "Due to its position high in the  sky in the Northern Hemisphere, M51 or the Whirlpool Galaxy is in a prime viewing location and stays there all night. This makes it a popular target for galaxy hunters. The beautiful spiral galaxy is energized by the gravitational pull of the nearby spherical galaxy that is believed to have passed completely through it long ago. This energy is a catalyst for the rapid formation of new stars that illuminate the well-defined arms of  the galaxy. A three hour exposure brings out soft colors and the faint, wispy veil of nebulosity that surrounds the galaxy."
