description: "Due to its position high in the  sky in the Northern Hemisphere, M51 or the Whirlpool Galaxy is in a prime viewing location and stays there all night. This makes it a popular target for galaxy hunters. The beautiful spiral galaxy is energized by the gravitational pull of the nearby spherical galaxy that is believed to have passed completely through it long ago. This energy is a catalyst for the rapid formation of new stars that illuminate the well-defined arms of the galaxy.

The 'fire' is the yellow dwarf galaxy NGC5195. It is slowly being pulled apart in a gravitational tug-of-war with the maelstrom: M51. My first images of this galaxy were painfully curated from thousands of short 10-second exposures, with me manually inspecting individual frames and spending days running algorithms to combine them. My newer technology allows me longer exposures (45 seconds up to 5 minutes) that I can more easily combine with filtered data from the hydrogen alpha to highlight the nebulae and stellar activity in the region. This first edition metal print was my first piece ever to appear in an exhibition and was displayed on Microsoft’s campus for several months in 2023 as a finalist in the digital photography category of the annual employee art exhibition."
