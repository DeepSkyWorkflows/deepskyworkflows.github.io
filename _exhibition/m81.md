description: "Bode's Galaxy is a grand spiral design galaxy located near the constellation Ursa Major. It is a bright galaxy moderately easy to find. For this image, about half of the exposures were taken with a full color camera. The other half used a 7 nanometer narrowband filter that passes light in the Hydrogen Alpha and Oxygen II areas of the spectrum. This effectively helps to filter out light pollution, increase the detail and signal, and exposes structures of heated dust that glow red."
