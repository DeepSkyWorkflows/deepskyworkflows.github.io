description: "Easily visible as bright pinpoints of light almost resembling a tiny version of the Big Dipper, the Pleiades go by many names including the Seven Sisters. They are the closest Messier object and the most recognizable cluster visible to the unaided eye. With longer exposures, thin filaments of nebulosity that reflect the young stars' blue glow appear, each enveloping one of the major stars including Maia and Merope. This shot was processed from 30 3-minute exposures."
