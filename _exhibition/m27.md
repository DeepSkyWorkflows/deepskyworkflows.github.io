description: "The Dumbbell Nebula, designated Messier 27, was discovered in 1764. It is the first so-called 'planetary nebula' to be discovered. The name comes from the round shape that resembles a planet. What you see is the outer layers of an old star that were shed and are expanding in waves of hydrogen, sulfer, and oxygen. "
