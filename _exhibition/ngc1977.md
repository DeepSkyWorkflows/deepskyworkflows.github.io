description: "The running man nebula is actually three nebulae in close proximity. Together they reflect and emit light that radiates with beautiful hues of cyan and purple. Surrounded by a frame of dark interstellar dust, the combination and orientation gives the impression of someone running mid-stride with their arms out in front and back. The fine details are revealed with long exposures at high magnification."
