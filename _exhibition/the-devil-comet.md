description: "The Devil's Comet earned its nickname due to cryovolcanic activity. Explosions of gases have been observed and one image gave it a distinct horned aspect. Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks is periodic, with an orbit every 71 years, making it a Halley-type comet. This year it was especially bright. I only had a few hours to image it after dusk, so I used a fast HyperStar system from the deck of some friends with an ocean view to avoid obstructions on the horizon. The comet is known for having an amazingly long and intricately detailed tail that I believe stands out in the metal print of this capture. It is in close proximity to bright star Hamal that glows like a diamond, hence: the Devil's diamond."
