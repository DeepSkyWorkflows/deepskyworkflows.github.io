description: "The Veil Nebula is one of my favorite targets due to its beauty and detail. The different gases of Hydrogen and Oxygen emit wispy filaments of blue and red that appear intertwined. A brilliant star, 52 Cyg, tries to steal the show from its perch on the peak of the veil. Also known as the Witch's Broom, the Veil is only a small part of a much larger structure called the Cygnus Loop, the aftermath of a supernova estimated to have been visible from Earth 10,000 years ago."
