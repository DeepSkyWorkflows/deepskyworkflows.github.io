description: "February 23, 2024 was an active day for our sun. In this image, the prominent sunspot on the lower left is AR3590. This mega-sunspot is larger than 9 earths and was a record for this 11-year  solar cycle (Solar Cycle 25). Although AR3590 was known to produce one of the largest and strongest solar flares of cycle 25, in this photograph you can clearly see a filament streaming out of AR3591 in the upper left. Combined with the fine-detailed prominences dancing across the edge of the sun's disk, this high resolution print is strikingly detailed and simply stunning to observe on a 4-foot square frame of black metal."
