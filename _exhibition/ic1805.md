description: "The Heart Nebula is an emission nebula that is visible due to glowing ionized hydrogen gas contrasted with lanes of dark dust. IC1805 hangs out next to Cassiopeia with its companions, the nearby Soul Nebula and the visually intersecting Fish Nebula. This image was captured with only a few minutes of exposure using a dualband seven-nanometer filter for Hydrogen Alpha and Oxygen II. The  Optolong L-eXtreme effectively filtered out light pollution while letting in the light emitted by Hydrogen Alpha to produce a dazzling image in a short period of time."
