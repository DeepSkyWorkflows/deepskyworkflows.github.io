description: "When I woke up on the morning of March 25th and looked at the mountain, I knew I had to take a picture. I scrambled to pull my gear together and attach my camera to the doublet telescope that would frame Mt. Rainier perfectly. I took several fast exposures but it was this single shot that captured the sunrise spilling over the mountain best. It was only later I noticed the flock of geese in a perfect line in the upper right corner. This is Mt. Rainier's North face."
