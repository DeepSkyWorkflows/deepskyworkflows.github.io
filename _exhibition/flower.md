description: "This is a unique print for several reasons. At 3 feet by 2 feet, it's the largest in my current collection. I also did not release the image to social media or my website. It was processed specifically for this metal print. Designated Caldwell 49, the Rosette Nebula is a large emission nebula. The radiation from nearby stars excites the atoms, causing them to release radiation of their own. The most detail is visible in the hydrogen alpha spectrum. The star cluster NGC2244 near its center is a group of stars believed to have been formed from the material in the nebula itself!"
