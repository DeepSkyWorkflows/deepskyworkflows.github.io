description: "The Rosette Nebula is a large, bright nebula that is easy to find near the Unicorn constellation. It's size and brightness make it a great target for 'ordinary' digital and mirrorless cameras without a telescope. This shot at a focal length of 400mm fails to capture the entire structure but zooms in on its center. NGC2244 is actually the cluster of young stars in the heart of this nebulae. It is the raditation from these stars that is responsible for ionizing the gas in NGC2237 and causing it to glow."
