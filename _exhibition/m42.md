description: "In February 2020, I set a telescope I just purchased outside my house and provided it with instructions to take pictures of an area in the sky. The target I chose was M42, the Great Orion Nebula. The intricate structure known as a diffuse nebula spans 24 light years of space. It is the closest known area of active star formation to earth at an estimated 1,300 light years away. The energy it emits earns its spot as the brightest nebula in the night sky. The glowing 'heart' is illuminated by four brilliant stars referred to as 'the Trapezium' beanth a flowing 'scarf' of dark gas that separates M42 from 'the head' or M43, Mairan's Nebula. This continues to be my favorite target. It is one of the first nebulae I photographed and the first print I ever made."
