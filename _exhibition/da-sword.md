description: "The Great Orion nebula (M42) is one of the largest, brightest, and complex structures visible to the naked eye. Under a telescope and with the right field of view, you can see the sweeping lanes of dust, the wicked swirl of smoky dark matter over Marian's nebula (M43), and the faintly purple backdrop behind the dusty silhouette of the running man. This piece was imaged using a fast imaging technique and combined with narrowband filters to provide as much structure and details as possible."
