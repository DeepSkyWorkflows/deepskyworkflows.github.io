description: "The first deep space object I photographed was M1: The Crab Nebula. I didn't realize it was the first item in Charles Messier's famous catalogue until after the fact. That image was noisy but just seeing the colors were enough to get me hooked. I later learned that the nebula is the remnants of a massive stellar explosion, or supernova, that was visible to Chinese astronomers in 1050 AD. It is expanding at such a rapid rate that modern images show differences when compared. I love the color and intricate details of this target."
