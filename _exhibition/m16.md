description: "The Pillars of Creation are towering columns of gas and dust that stretch higher than multiple trips from the Sun to Pluto and back. It is the heart of the Eagle Nebula, a massive nebula that resides in an area densely populated with nebulae as you gaze into the heart of the Milky Way. This is my effort using hundreds of short, 10-second exposures."
