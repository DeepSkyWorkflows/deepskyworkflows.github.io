description: "I planned over a year for this total solar eclipse. I dragged gear across the country and watched the forecast predict thunderstorms as the day drew near. The experience itself was unforgettable. Here is my story about, and my photographs of, the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse. Taken on location in Hot Springs, Arkansas."
