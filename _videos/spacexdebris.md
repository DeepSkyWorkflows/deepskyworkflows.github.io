description: "I captured this video at 2:53am on April 27, 2023 in Colorado Springs. On March 12, 2023 the joint NASA and SpaceX Crew-5 Dragon mission jettisoned a cylinder for storage called the 'trunk' before return to Earth. This video shows the trunk breaking up on an uncontrolled re-entry a month later."
