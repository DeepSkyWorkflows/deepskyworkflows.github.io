description: "Using the same set of data and the default, auto-recommended settings for each program, I stacked a series of images (including lights, darks, flats, and dark flats) using several major free and commercial applications including Astrometric Stacking Program (ASTAP), ASI DeepStack, AstroPixel Processor (APP), Deep Sky Stacker (DSS) and PixInsight. I was surprised by the results and may have a new favorite!"
