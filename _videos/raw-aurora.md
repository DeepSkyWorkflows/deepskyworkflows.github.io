description: "The night of May 10th 2024 we experienced a massive geomagnetic storm, estimated by some to be one of the top three in recorded history. A massive pair of corneal mass ejections (CMEs) combined and slammed into the earth head on, pushing the magnetic ring so far south that the KP index hit 9 in Oregon. This video is all 822 frames I captured that evening in sequential order."
