description: "It was a rare night in the Pacific Northwest. The forecast predicted a few hours of clear skies. With no optical tube assembly (OTA), I decided to test drive my new Celestron CGEM-II mount with my Sony Alpha 6300. I also filmed some time lapse with my ZWO ASI120MM-S. This is the true story of what happened."
