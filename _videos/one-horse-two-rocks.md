description: "Join me on a magical journey from Otter Rock to outer space. Starting at a 20mm focal length, we zoom into the constellation Orion as it sets over Gull Rock. See the jewels on Orion's belt, catch the flame and see just how smoky that horse head is at a 6,000mm (6 meter) focal length. A moving art piece that integrates five images from my collection."
