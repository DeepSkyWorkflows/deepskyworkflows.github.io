description: "The moon. The Milky Way. The Rho Ophiuchi complex. So many targets, and just one night. In this video, I share the experience of watching the sun, moon, and Orion nebula constellation set to be replaced by the beautiful expanse of stars and the Scorpion nebulae which hides a complex and rare nebula."
