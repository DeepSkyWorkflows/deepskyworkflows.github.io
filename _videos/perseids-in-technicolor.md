description: "I set up my tripod on Agate Beach far away from the parking lot with a few goals in mind. I wanted to capture the moon as it set, the Milky Way after the moon set, and the Perseid meteor shower. Only, something was wrong with the sky. It was green! Then I realized it was another display of Northern Lights. It was quite the evening of aurora and Perseid meteors. I can't wait to share the Milky Way shot when it's ready."
