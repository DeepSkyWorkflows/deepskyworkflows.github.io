description: "On January 15, 2024, I used a Coronado PST 40mm single-stacked solar telescope in conjunction with a ZWO ASI294MM Pro monochrome camera and a ZWO ASI290MM Mini camera to observe the sun. The surface was very active and massive superheated columns of plasma were spewing from its surface. I recorded these videos and images to share."
