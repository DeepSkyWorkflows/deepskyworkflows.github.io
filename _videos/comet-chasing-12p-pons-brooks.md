description: "On March 16th, 2024. I headed to Agate Beach with my wife on a mission: to capture a comet as it threaded the needle between two galaxies as it set over the ocean by a lighthouse. Oh, and the International Space Station. See how I planned it, the gear I used, my set up, and what it ultimately produced."

This is a behind the scenes look at how I created the image, "[The Galactic Menagerie of Comets, Galaxies and Things](/gallery/galactic-menagerie/)." This is my first image to earn an accolade at AstroBin.com as a [Top Pick Nominee](https://www.astrobin.com/zzta4l/C/).
